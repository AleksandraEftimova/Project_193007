# Project_193007
 Web Application created using the Green Sock (GSAP) animation library
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.3.

## Installing needed packages
In order to correctly prepare the environment, please open the Terminal and run the following commands:
```
cd ThriftTreasures-fe
npm i
npm run install-all
```
After installing npm in the proper folder, please run the following command in order to install the animation library:
```
npm install gsap
```
If you run across any errors, please check whether you're located in the correct folder and try running the previous commands again. In case of installation warnings, please run the recommended command in the terminal:
```npm audit fix```


## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server. The application will open on `http://localhost:4200/`, but in order to view the animations, please check whether you have installed the <u>**Live Serve Extension**</u>. Go Live with **Live Server** and the application will open on <u>**Port:5500**</u>. 

You can open the files from the browser or select and open them from the file editor and view them together with the live animations from GSAP library.

The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
